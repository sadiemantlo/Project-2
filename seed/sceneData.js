The previous owner, Lord Prendergast, was as eccentric as he was rich. When he died, his will stated that whoever could last a full night in the manor would earn the rights to his lavish fortune. You and your friends agreed to stay the night together, then split your winnings. Unbeknownst to your group, the mansion is a death trap.
